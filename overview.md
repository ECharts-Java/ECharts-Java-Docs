# Overview

## Design Philosophy

ECharts Java is a simple but comprehensive Data Visualization Library based on [Apache ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html).

Regarding simplicity, ECharts Java redesigns a series of APIs related to drawing charts, making the process of ploting more intuitive. Moreover, since the APIs of Apache ECharts may be a little more complicated and tedious, we simplify some APIs in ECharts Java.

With regard to the comprehensiveness, ECharts Java keeps the idea of "Everything is Option" from ECharts. To this end, ECharts Java preserves the methods of constructing an Option object from scratch. Users can make any Option objects as long as they are supported by Apache ECharts. Besides, we improved users' experience of constructing an Option object in Java with ways of methods chaining.
